# PyGremlin

This is a project to create a graph library similar (but not nearly as
powerful) as the [Gremlin](https://github.com/tinkerpop/gremlin/) project.

One aspect of the library I am experimenting with is not having a central
`Graph` class, and just using `Vertex`s and `Edge`s.  The reason behind this is that,
it is my understanding that a graph doesn't really have a 'beginning' or an
'end' like a lot of datastructures do (like lists), so potentially any node
in the graph could be a starting point for traversal algorithms.  I am still
researching this, but at this point I don't see a lot of point to having a
`Graph` class, it seems like it would just be a wrapper around 2 lists: a
list of all the `Vertex`s,and a list of all the `Edge`s.
